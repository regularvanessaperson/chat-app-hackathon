## Chatroom App
------------------------
I wanted to build a simple app with the goal of learning how to use socket.io. I have built an app using Next.js before but this time I felt more comfortable and finally understand the relationship between pages and components. The user can choose a chat room and talk to other users that are currently in the chatroom but their name and messages are not stored. 

### Technologies Used
------------------------
- Socket.io
- Next.js
- Tailwindcss


### Wireframes
------------------------

- Dark mode using Tailwindcss
